# Sublime RSpec Syntax

Syntax for Ruby [RSpec](https://rspec.info/) tests. It is originally based on https://github.com/fnando/sublime-better-rspec (which seems abandoned) and extended. It aims to only include the syntax, nothing else.

## Installation

This package is not on packagecontrol.io (yet?).

### Git Clone

Clone this repository into the Sublime Text “Packages” directory, which is located where ever the “Preferences” -> “Browse Packages” option in sublime takes you.

## Syntax Detection

The best way of setting the syntax automatically is using the [ApplySyntax](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/ApplySyntax) package.
